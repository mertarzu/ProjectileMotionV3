# Projectile Motion

## Overview
This application simulates projectile motion in a 3D environment using Unity which I had developed in April 2022 as a one-week project, t It allows users to launch a projectile from a fixed point A to a target point B with mouse clicks, demonstrating the principles of projectile motion and the effect of different parameters on the ball's trajectory.

## Key Features

### Ball Trajectory Control
- **User-Defined Launch and Target Points**: Set points A and B in the 3D space with mouse clicks to determine the projectile's path.
- **Adjustable Maximum Height (Hmax)**: Modify the peak height of the projectile's arc, affecting the trajectory's curvature.
- **Variable Movement Speed**: Alter the speed of the projectile's flight to influence its motion duration.

## Using the Application
1. **Adjust Parameters**: Use the UI sliders or input fields to set the Max Height and Movement Speed.
2. **Set Launch Point (Point A)**: Click in the 3D space to choose the starting point of the projectile.
3. **Determine Target Point (Point B)**: A second click sets the endpoint and initiates the projectile's motion.
4. **Observe the Trajectory**: Watch the path of the projectile as it moves through the 3D space.
5. **Repeat and Experiment**: Modify settings and launch points to explore different trajectories.
